# Expressions and operators
**JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.**

+ Assignment operators
+ Comparison operators
+ Arithmetic operators
+ Bitwise operators
+ Logical operators
+ String operators
+ Conditional (ternary) operator
+ Comma operator
+ Unary operators
+ Relational operators

Name |	Shorthand operator |Meaning
-----|---------------------|--------
Assignment |	x = y	| x = y
Addition assignment |	x += y |	x = x + y
Subtraction assignment|	x -= y |	x = x - y
Multiplication assignment|	x *= y | 	x = x * y
Division assignment|	x /= y|	x = x / y
Remainder assignment|	x %= y|	x = x % y
Exponentiation assignment|	x **= y|	x = x ** y
Left shift assignment|	x <<= y|	x = x << y
Right shift assignment|	x >>= y|	x = x >> y
Unsigned right shift assignment|	x >>>= y|	x = x >>> y
Bitwise AND assignment|	x &= y|	x = x & y
Bitwise XOR assignment|	x ^= y|	x = x ^ y
Logical AND assignment|	x &&= y|	x && (x = y)
Logical nullish assignment|	x ??= y|	x ?? (x = y)
# Loops and iteration
### Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:
## for statement
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.  

**for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])  statement **
## do...while statement
The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.  
**do  
  statement  
while (condition);**
## while statement
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while  
**while (condition)  
statement**
