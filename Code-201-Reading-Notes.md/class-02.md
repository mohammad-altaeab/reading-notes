# Html tags 
we using tags to creat the web page this tags provide extra maening and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page 
### Headings
from h1 to h6 between <> each one have meaning like h1 is the largest .
1. h1 :is used for main headings 
2. h2 : is used for subheadings If there are further sections under the subheadings then the
3. h3 : element is used, and so on ...
### Paragraphs : p and /p between <>
By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line with some space between it and any subsequent paragraphs.
### Bold & It alic : b and i 
+ b : characters appear bold.
+ i : make characters appear italic.
### Superscript & Subscript : sub and sup 
```

    The <sup> element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power such as 22.

```
```
The <sub> element is used to
contain characters that should
be subscript. It is commonly
used with foot notes or chemical
formulas such as H20.
```
### Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules
```

<br />
As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line. But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag <br />.
```

```

<hr /> 
To create a break between themes — such as a change of
topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the <hr /> tag.
```
***There are a few elements that do not have any words between an opening and closing tag. They are known as empty elements and they are written differently. An empty element usually has only one tag. Before the closing angled bracket of an empty element there will often be a space and a forward slash character. Some web page authors miss this out but it is a good habit to get into.***
### Strong & Emphasis
~~~
<strong>
The use of the <strong> element indicates that its content has strong importance. For example, the words contained in this element mightbe said with strong emphasis. By default, browsers will show the contents of a <strong> element in bold.
~~~
~~~
<em>
The <em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence. By default browsers will show the contents of an <em> element in italic.
~~~
# CSS 
CSS Properties Affect How Elements Are Dis played ***CSS*** declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.
## Using External CSS
~~~
link
The <link> element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page. It is an empty element (meaning it does not need a closing tag), and it lives inside the <head> element. It should use three attributes:
href
This specifies the path to the CSS file (which is often placed in a folder called css or styles).
type
This attribute specifies the type of document being linked to. The value should be text/css.
rel
This specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. The value should be stylesheet when linking to a CSS file
~~~
## Using Internal CSS

```
You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a <style> element,
which usually sits inside the <head> element of the page. The <style> element should use the type attribute to indicate that the styles are specified in CSS. The value should be text css.
```
## CSS Selectors
There are many different types of CSS selector that allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document. The table on the opposite page introduces the most commonly used CSS selectors.  

# javascript
have **for loop**, **if statment** ,**while statment** and more to do many functions and operation 
## logical operators
