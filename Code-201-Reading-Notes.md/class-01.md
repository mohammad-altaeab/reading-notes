+ how javascript makes web pages more intracative     

   1. **access content **:  you can use javascript to select any element,attribute or text from an ~HTML~ page for example :   
      - Select the text inside all of the <hl>elements on a page
      - Select any elements that have a class attribute with a value of note
      - Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a valuevof emai 1
   2. **MODIFY CONTENT **:You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example:
      +  Add a paragraph of text after the first <hl> element
      + Change the value of c 1 ass attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements
      + Change the size or position of an <i mg> element
   3. ** PROGRAM RULES** : You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:  
      - A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image.   
      -  A mortgage calculator could collect values from a fo rm, perform a calculation, and display repayments.
      - An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area (also known as the viewport).    
   4. **REACT TO EVENTS**: You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For example, it could be run when:
      +  A button is pressed
      +  A link is clicked (or tapped) on
      +  A cursor hovers over an element 
      + Information is added to a form 
      + An interval of time has passed
      + A web page has finished loading
