# HTML & CSS
You may know that HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. The HyperText part refers to the fact that HTML allows you to create links that allow visitors to move from one
page to another quickly and easily. A markup language allows you to annotate text, and these annotations provide additional meaning to the contents of a document. If you think of a web page, we add code around the original text we want to display and the browser then uses the code to display the page correctly. So the tags we add are the markup.
HTML Use Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages called (*tages*) Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags   
***Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value separated by an equals sign. ***
## Body, Head & Title:
### <body>
You met the <body> element in the first example we created. Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.       


### <head>
Before the <body> element you will often see a <head> element.This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window that is highlighted in blue on the opposite page). You will usually find a <title> element inside the <head> element.
### <title>
The contents of the <title> element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).
## How the Web Works :
When you visit a website, the web server
hosting that site could be anywhere in the
world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.  
1. When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). You type a domain name or web address into your browser to visit a site; for example: google.com,bbc.co.uk, microsoft.com.    
2. Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books; they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name. An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods full stops. Every  
3. The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you
requested. A web server is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users.  
4. The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.



# javascript 
1. ** javascript can be used in browsers to make websites more intracative,interesting and user-friendly by accessing and modifying the contentand markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browserjavascript encompasses many of the trditional riles of programming it can make the web page feel intracative by responding to what the user does.**   
To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.  

2. *** jQuery make writing alot easier ***

+ how javascript makes web pages more intracative     

   1. **access content **:  you can use javascript to select any element,attribute or text from an ~HTML~ page for example :   
      - Select the text inside all of the <hl>elements on a page
      - Select any elements that have a class attribute with a value of note
      - Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a valuevof emai 1
   2. **MODIFY CONTENT **:You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example:
      +  Add a paragraph of text after the first <hl> element
      + Change the value of c 1 ass attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements
      + Change the size or position of an <i mg> element
   3. ** PROGRAM RULES** : You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:  
      - A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image.   
      -  A mortgage calculator could collect values from a fo rm, perform a calculation, and display repayments.
      - An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area (also known as the viewport).    
   4. **REACT TO EVENTS**: You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For example, it could be run when:
      +  A button is pressed
      +  A link is clicked (or tapped) on
      +  A cursor hovers over an element 
      + Information is added to a form 
      + An interval of time has passed
      + A web page has finished loading      

1. DEFINE THE GOAL
First, you need to define the task you want to
achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the
computer to solve.
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT
To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this
puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart.
You can then write down individual steps that the
computer needs to perform in order to complete
each individual task (and any information it needs to
perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it
can follow.
3. CODE EACH STEP
Each of the steps needs to be written in a
programming language that the compu ter
understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.
As tempting as it can be to start coding straight
away, it pays to spend time designing your script
before you start writing it.
