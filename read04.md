# javascript 
* JavaScript ***( JS)*** is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based,multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.  
* JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language, widely used for controlling web page behavior.
### JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
These unique names are called **identifiers**.  
1. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.     
2. Names must begin with a letter   
3. Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)  
4. Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)  
5. Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.    
* we can identified by (=) like : ***x = x + 5***
### JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".
In programming, text values are called text strings.
JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.
Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.
If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string
* var pi = 3.14;
* var person = "John Doe";
* var answer = 'Yes I am!';

### JavaScript Arithmetic
As with algebra, you can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables, using operators like = and +:  
* var x = "John" + " " + "Doe";
* var x = "5" + 2 + 3; ** If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings**  
* var x = 5 + 2 + 3;
